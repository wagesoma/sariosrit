# Architecture Overview

Sariosrit is built as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for community voting using Next.js, React, and blockchain interaction. This document provides an overview of the project's architecture.

## Frontend
The frontend of Sariosrit is developed using Next.js and React. It provides the user interface for interacting with the DAO, including voting on proposals and viewing voting results.

## Backend
The backend of Sariosrit handles interactions with the blockchain and business logic for processing voting transactions. It is implemented using Node.js and Ethereum-compatible libraries such as ethers.js.

## Database
Sariosrit utilizes blockchain technology as its database for storing voting records and governance-related data. Each voting transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Integrations
Sariosrit integrates with various blockchain protocols and Web3 libraries to interact with smart contracts and Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps).

## Scalability
The architecture of Sariosrit is designed to be scalable, allowing for potential growth in the number of users and transactions. Decentralization and blockchain technology ensure robustness and reliability.

## Security
Security is a top priority in the Sariosrit architecture. Measures are implemented to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of voting transactions.
